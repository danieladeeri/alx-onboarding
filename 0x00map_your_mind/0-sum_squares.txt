This program calculates the sum of squares of given input of numbers
Take given input of numbers as N
   Read the given input of numbers
   if ctr equals to 0, then sum equals to 0
      Read available numbers
      calculate ctr to be equal to ctr plus 1
      compute the square of the numbers
      the sum will be equal to sum *sqr.
   if ctr is less than N then repeat steps 3 to 6
   Print sum
   end
